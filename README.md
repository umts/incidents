This is a prototype of UMass Transit's incident tracking model, designed for use by the Valley Area Transit Company and Springfield Area Transit Company.

## Development

After bundling and database setup, you can obtain data either by seeding:

```
rails db:seed
```

Or by importing XML files from Hastus:

```
rails users:import users.xml
rails reason_codes:import reason_codes.xml
# coming soon to a README near you
```

Note that Hastus will import all supervisors as the same with no distinction between dispatchers and staff members.
To elevate the appropriate administrative staff, record their full names in a .txt file and run e.g.:

```
rails users:elevate_staff staff.txt
```

### Email

We develop using mailcatcher. They don't recommend listing it in the Gemfile, so install with `gem install mailcatcher`.
Then run `mailcatcher`, daemon by default, to catch mail and to `localhost:1080` to view the sent mail.

### Claims integration

To set up claims integration in your development environment, configure the appropriate database in database.yml under the name `claims_development`.

Then as a mysql user with access to that database, type:

```sql
> USE your_database_name_here;
> source setup-claims.sql;
```
